# Day1: Bolu or Odun

Write a function that takes in a string of one word without any spaces or special character. If the string contains any special character, print “Please remove all spaces or special characters”. If the string passed to the function is either Bolu or Odun, print “Welcome back, Bolu” or “Welcome back, Odun”. If the string passed is none of the two, print “It is nice to meet you, ” concatenated with the string passed.

# Example

```
foo("Micheal Jackson") # Please remove all spaces or special characters
foo("Micheal") # It is nice to meet you, Micheal
foo("Bolu") # Welcome back, Bolu
foo("Bolu") # Welcome back, Odun
```
